### Technical Requirements

This tutorial runs on ***\*Python 3\**** (Py3.4+ should be fine), and requires the following main packages:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `torch` (of course ðŸ˜„)
- `torchvision`

The complete list of requirements is available in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt)

Detailed (**step-by-step**) instructions to setup the Python virtual environment on your local machine are also available [here](./setup.md).

If you don't want to bother setting up everything on your local computer (__and also have a pretty good internet connection_) you might also consider the following two alternatives:
